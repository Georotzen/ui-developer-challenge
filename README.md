#SendGrid UI / Web Developer Challenge

We want to see your amazing UI development skills in action!  Please take 2 hours or less to complete this fun code challenge:

### Steps to get going

* Check out the included UI design (Sketch or PDF formats are included) that we’d like to see you implement. You can download [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) free for 30 days.

* Use rbenv or rvm to install Ruby 2.2.2

* Check out [MaterializeCSS form elements](http://materializecss.com/forms.html) for a visual example of how the label/placeholder interaction on text input fields should work.

* Get the Rails app running on your computer and work your magic to bring our Sketch file to life!

### When you're done
Please email us a zip file containing all the folders in your Github project.  Or, if you don’t mind it being public, you can fork it to your own repo and email us the link.

We can’t wait to see your work!
